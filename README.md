# ----------Gimhara ChatBot | Gemini | Google AI

Welcome to Gimhara ChatBot! This interactive chatbot is powered by Google's generative AI model Gemini. The chatbot allows users to communicate with the AI through text input or image uploads. It provides real-time responses based on the input provided by the user.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Interface:** Users can engage with the chatbot in real-time through a user-friendly interface.

- **Text and Image Input:** The chatbot accepts both text and image inputs, enabling versatile interactions.

- **Real-time Chat History:** Chat history is displayed in real-time, allowing users to review past interactions.

- **Seamless Integration:** The chatbot seamlessly integrates with Streamlit, providing a smooth user experience.

## 💻 Installation

## 📚 Lessons Learned

During the development of the Gemini ChatBot Streamlit app, several valuable lessons were learned and challenges were encountered:

- **Gemini Integration**: Integrating with the Gemini AI model from Google required understanding the API's capabilities and authentication process. Properly configuring the API key and handling responses from the Gemini model were crucial for successful integration.

- **Streamlit Development**: Developing the chatbot interface with Streamlit involved learning how to create interactive widgets, handle user input, and display dynamic content. Understanding Streamlit's layout and functionality was essential for building a user-friendly and responsive interface.

- **Python Programming**: Extensive use of Python programming language was necessary for implementing the chatbot functionality, handling file uploads, and processing user inputs. Leveraging Python's libraries, such as PIL for image processing and io for file handling, facilitated various aspects of the application development.

- **User Interaction**: Designing an intuitive user interaction flow required careful consideration of user inputs, error handling, and providing informative feedback. Balancing simplicity and functionality was important to ensure a positive user experience.

- **Testing and Debugging**: Testing the app with different inputs and scenarios helped identify potential issues, such as handling errors during API requests, managing state across user interactions, and ensuring consistent behavior across different input types (text vs. image).

- **Documentation and Best Practices**: Documenting the codebase, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and code comments, was essential for facilitating collaboration and future maintenance. Adhering to best practices for code organization, readability, and error handling ensured the app's reliability and maintainability.
